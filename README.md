# PySmellDetection


**** Textual Smell Detection  ****
 
 The demand for frequent changes in time constraints and the need to maintain the quality of code, test and ongoing maintenance of software has become a challenge for developers. Additionally, the lack of proper documentation during software programming and the fact that many developers do not follow programming standards can lead to a decrease in the software development cycle.

Over time, these non-operational defects, known as "smelly or dirty code," can accumulate. Several methods have been developed to detect and identify these smells in code. One of the most important methods is using metrics based on the structure of the code, known as the "component-method metric."

By analyzing the set of code errors, or smells, these errors can be easily identified in the source code components by detecting promiscuous responsibilities. For example, the "Blob smell" is a definition of a large class that includes various tasks, and the "Envy feature smell" refers to the connection or belonging of a method with several classes.

 
 The structure of project ::
 
__there is a parser to retrieve components of code like as class, method or fuction in java language programming for both types
of Blob and Long method Smells.

__ the results are the separated methods and classes in text known as document. Text files includes the seperated document of project 
like Apache Ant and Apache Ivy in java version 8.0. 

__ Each Document includes some blocks and the texual analysis and inforamtion retrieval will be implimented on one set of it.
