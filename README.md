# PySmellDetection


**** Textual Smell Detection  ****
 
 In general, demand for frequent changes in time constraints, the ease of maintaining the quality of codes, testing and 
 ongoing maintenance of a software has become one of the challenges for developers. Also, the lack of proper documentation 
 during software programming and the fact that many developers do not follow the standards of programming, they apply the easiest 
 possible way to implement changes and this will cause a technical drop in  software programming cycle.
 
 Over time, these non-operational defects (poor design and implementation) known as smelly or dirty code.
 Several methods have been provided for detecting and identifying the smell codes. One of the most important of these methods 
 is the metric based on the body of code, which is the main solution to determine code smells by the structural characteristics
 of components of code (component-method metric).
 
 ****************************************************************
 Based on the analysis of the set of code errors (smell) ,identifying these errors in the source code components are easily done
 by detecting promiscuous responsibilities. For example, in Blob smell, it is a definition of a large class that includes various
 tasks or envy feature smell that refers to the connection or belonging of a method with several classes.

 The structure of project ::
 
 First phase :
 
__there is a parser to retrieve components of code like as class, method or fuction in java language programming for both types
of Blob and Long method Smells.

__ the results are the separated methods and classes in text known as document. Text files includes the seperated document of project 
like Apache Ant and Apache Ivy in java version 8.0. 

__ Each Document includes some blocks and the texual analysis and inforamtion retrieval will be implimented on one set of it.
